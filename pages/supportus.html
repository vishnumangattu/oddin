    <h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
<div class="discription">
    <h5>How will my money be used?</h5>
    <p>Your money will be used to pay for the costs of running The Odin Project. This includes paying for the <br>servers that host the website, the domain name, and any other costs associated with running the project.<br> Your money does not go towards paying the maintainers. All of our expenses are documented directly on<br> the Open Collective website.</p>
</div>
<div class="discription">
    <h5>How can I donate?</h5>
    <p>You can donate via Open Collective, by setting up a recurring donation or with a one time payment.</p>
</div>
<div class="discription">

</div>
<div class="discription">

<div class="discription">

</div>
<div class="discription">
    <h5>What are the benefits of donating?</h5>
    <p>Your donation helps us continue to provide a world-class and completely free coding curriculum for anyone<br> and everyone eager to learn. We believe that this material should be available for free to anyone that needs<br> it, and donations from those that have the means to contribute help keep it available for everyone!</p><br>
    <p>In additon to the above, donors get a special 'backer' role in our discord server as a small bit of recognition.</p>
</div>
<div class="discription">
    <h5>How do I get the 'backer' role on Discord?</h5>
    <p>Use the /opencollective command in our discord server to verify your Open Collective account. You will <br>then be automatically given the 'backer' role. You will be prompted to provide your Open Collective <br>username, which is found in the URL of your Open Collective profile. For example, if your profile URL is <br>https://opencollective.com/rick-astley your username is rick-astley.</p><br>
    <p>If you want to remove the role for any reason, contact staff on discord through ModMail.</p>
</div>
<div class="discription">
    <h5>Do users with the 'backer' role get any exclusive benefits?</h5>
    <p>No. The role is just a way for us to show our appreciation for your support.</p>
</div>
<div class="discription">
    <h5>Does becoming a donor mean I get priority support in the chat?</h5>
    <p>No. We feel strongly that everyone should be treated equally in our community, regardless of whether or<br> not they are a donor.</p>
</div>
<div class="discription">
    <h5>I cannot afford to donate right now. What are some other ways I can help The Odin Project?</h5>
    <p>You can help us by contributing to our open source projects. You can also help us by spreading the word<br> about The Odin Project. Tell your friends, family, and coworkers about us. Share our content on social <br>media. The more people that know about us, the more people we can help.</p>

    <h5>What ever happened to Thinkful? Viking Code School?</h5>
    <p>When The Odin Project was created by Eric Trautman in 2013, it was primarily funded by Eric's other<br> project, the for-profit Viking Code School. Eric wanted Odin to be free, and kept it that way by placing a<br> small ad for Viking Code School on the website.</p><br>
    <p>In late 2017, Viking Code School was acquired by Thinkful. As a part of that acquisition, Thinkful agreed to<br> continue funding The Odin Project, in return for an ad on The Odin Project website.</p><br>
    <p>In 2019, Thinkful was acquired by Chegg. Chegg was nothing but supportive, and continued funding us the<br> entire time. However we began to feel that it might be in our best interest to become self-funding, to avoid<br> the risk of being acquired by a company that might not be as supportive.</p><br>
    <p>In 2023, we decided to begin the process of parting ways with Chegg, and become self-funding. We are<br> now funded entirely by donations.</p>
